# Vision-Darts

Automate the scoring of steel darts using computer vision and deep learning with the help of a Flask web server. This project combines hardware components, including a 3D-printed frame and a Raspberry Pi camera, to detect darts on the board and determine the points scored. The web server allows users to interact with the system and view scoring information in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Automated scoring of steel darts.
- Utilizes computer vision and deep learning for accurate detection and scoring.
- 3D-printed frame designed for easy setup and camera positioning.
- Real-time scoring display and logging via a user-friendly Flask web interface.

## Prerequisits
Before getting started, make sure you have the following:
* Raspberry Pi with the required peripherals.
